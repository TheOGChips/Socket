# Socket
A C++ wrapper class for the C socket API.

The intent behind this is to make socket programming using the C socket API easier to use. Socket programming already isn't easy, and as far as I'm aware, there isn't an equivalent in the C++ STL somewhere.

This code currently here isn't perfect, but it does work. A server and client can successfully send messages to each other. There are just some minor bugs that need to be fixed, which I'll get to when I have the time.
